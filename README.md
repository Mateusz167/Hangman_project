# Hangman Project

Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This repository contains the implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python.

## Overview

Hangman is a word guessing game where the player attempts to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This project is implemented in Python and includes a simple text-based interface. It was created for learning purposes to enhance my understanding of Python and game development.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list
- Allows the player to guess letters one at a time
- Displays the word with correctly guessed letters and underscores for remaining letters
- Keeps track of incorrect guesses and displays a visual representation of the hangman
- Ends the game when the player either guesses the word or runs out of guesses

## Project Structure
- main.py: The main script to run the Hangman game.
- hangman_word.py - Words database.
- hangman_art - File include the logo and arts using during the game.
- README.md: The readme file you are currently reading.
